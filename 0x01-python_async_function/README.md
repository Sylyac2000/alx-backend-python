## 0x01. Python - Async

## Requirements
* Language: Javascript, Python 3.7 (and C )
* OS: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
* Compiler: python3  (and gcc 9.3.0)
* Version: MySQL  8.0.25
* Style guidelines: [Pycodestyle] (https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

async and await syntax
* How to execute an async program with asyncio
* How to run concurrent coroutines
* How to create asyncio tasks
* How to use the random module

## Synopsis
This repository holds some python projects I worked on at ALX SPECIALIZATION.

## Requirements
##General
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
* Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
* All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

## Tasks

* 0. The basics of async
* 1. Let's execute multiple coroutines at the same time with async
* 2. Measure the runtime
* 3. Tasks
* 4. Tasks
